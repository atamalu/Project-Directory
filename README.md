# Project Directory

These are some projects that I have done independently or for consultant work. This page aims to serve as a way to summarize previous projects - along with markdowns explaining them - to display some of my skillsets.

## Statistics

#### [Simulation Studies](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims)
This project contains elaborate examples of common statistical models using simulated data from hypothetical studies. Each markdown simulates, visualizes, and models the data. These steps are followed by an easily-understandable interpretation of the results in terms of the study. For more complex designs, the logic behind most steps are also explained (see: factorial multilevel model). I currently have 4 completed:

- [Simple linear regression](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/Simple_Regression/simple_regression.md)
- [t-test (AB test)](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/t_test/t_test.md)
- [One-way ANOVA](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/one_way_anova/one_way_anova.md)
- [Multilevel model: factorial design](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/Multilevel_Factorial/Multilevel_Factorial.md)

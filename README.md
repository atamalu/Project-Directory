# Project Directory

These are some projects that I have done independently or for consultant work. This page aims to serve as a way to summarize previous projects - along with markdowns explaining them - to display some of my skillsets.

## Statistics

#### [Simulation Studies](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims)
This project contains elaborate examples of common statistical models using simulated data from hypothetical studies. Each markdown simulates, visualizes, and models the data. These steps are followed by an easily-understandable interpretation of the results in terms of the study. For more complex designs, the logic behind most steps are also explained. I currently have 4 completed:

* [Simple linear regression](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/Simple_Regression/simple_regression.md)
* [t-test (AB test)](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/t_test/t_test.md)
* [One-way ANOVA](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/one_way_anova/one_way_anova.md)
* [Multilevel model: factorial design](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/Multilevel_Factorial/Multilevel_Factorial.md)

## Functions

### R

#### GCalcium Package 
([cran version](https://github.com/atamalu/GCalcium) ..... [github version](https://github.com/atamalu/GCalcium))
The functions in this R packages aim to expedite the data manipulation, exploration, and transformation processes that are useful in working with waveform data. I initially wrote this for a pilot study at University of Colorado when we were testing out GCaMP6 calcium fluorescence imaging, and have been using it ever since. The vignette for the cran version explains the functions in more detail.

### Python

#### [BlueStacksADB](https://github.com/atamalu/BlueStacksADB)
These Python functions are essentially shortcuts in connecting to and controlling the BlueStacks android emulator. I wrote these functions in python so I could compile scripts that automated a few tedious processes in a mobile game I play. The included `MSMbot` files take advantage of these functions.

# Project Directory

These are some projects that I have done independently or for consultant work. This page aims to summarize previous projects and link to them to show some of my skillsets.

## Statistics

#### [Simulation Studies](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims)

This project contains elaborate examples of common statistical models using simulated data from hypothetical studies. Each markdown simulates, visualizes, and models the data. These steps are followed by an easily-understandable interpretation of the results in terms of the study. For more complex designs, the logic behind most steps are also explained. I currently have 4 completed:

* [Simple linear regression](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/Simple_Regression/simple_regression.md)
* [t-test (AB test)](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/t_test/t_test.md)
* [One-way ANOVA](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/one_way_anova/one_way_anova.md)
* [Multilevel model: factorial design](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/Multilevel_Factorial/Multilevel_Factorial.md)

## Functions

### R

#### GCalcium Package 
[cran version](https://github.com/atamalu/GCalcium)
[github version](https://github.com/atamalu/GCalcium)

The functions in this R packages aim to expedite the data manipulation, exploration, and transformation processes that are useful in working with waveform data. I initially wrote this for a pilot study at University of Colorado when we were testing out GCaMP6 calcium fluorescence imaging, and have been using it ever since. The vignette for the cran version explains the functions in more detail.

#### [StockGather](https://github.com/atamalu/StockGather)

These functions were made out of my interest in the stock market. The eventual goal is to re-write and use them to assess the market using 1.) sentimental analysis on news articles about stocks, and 2.) text mining of that company's financial documents. As of right now, it's an interactive way of pulling news articles on stocks and the respective company's financial documents.

### Python

#### [BlueStacksADB](https://github.com/atamalu/BlueStacksADB)

These Python functions are essentially shortcuts in connecting to and controlling the BlueStacks android emulator. I wrote these functions so I could compile scripts that automate a few tedious processes in a mobile game I play. The included `MSMbot` files take advantage of these functions.

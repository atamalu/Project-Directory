These are some projects that I have done independently or for consultant work. This page aims to serve as a way to summarize previous projects - along with markdowns explaining them - to display some of my skillsets.

### Business examples

A statistical model is created, explained, and visualized for each scenario. The logic of business decisions for these scenarios are also discussed.

- Linear regression 
- Logistic regression
- ANOVA
- Multilevel models
